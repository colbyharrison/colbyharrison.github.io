    <p>Hello, my name is Colby Harrison. I am a 4th year Computer Science major at University of California, San Diego. </p>

    <p>Check out my resume for my technical skills</p>

    <p>Head over to my projects section to view projects I have worked on. </p>
    <p>Before attending school I traveled around the United States and Canada in my car for a year. During this time I worked for room and board at ranches and restaurants in French Canada. Near the end of my trip I worked on a boat called the Wanderbird. During my time on the boat we steamed from Maine to the Caribbean. At the end of this I came back fully ready to go to school.</p>
