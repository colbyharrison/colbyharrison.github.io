I want something that is unique and] fun with to play with(or at least interesting):
What makes an interesting website?
I really like: http://whsieh.github.io/
	I like it because it is definitely unique, and simple, it provides the user with the user in an interesting
	way. I think it is near perfect. No wonder this guy is working for apple.

And Jeremy's isnt bad either: Though I think Jeremy's is perhaps a little too simple. 

I guess what i need to do is find some website that I really like and then make it better. I don't feel very creative
rigght now. An idea I have is bars on the side of the page containing words. When you click on one it slides out shoots
down a document holding the information i want to share. How do I go about this? What tools do I need. Well one thing
I know is that needs to be a static page so hmm
