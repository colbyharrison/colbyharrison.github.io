                  CSE 110(Software Engineering) was designed to be run like a business. Every person in the ten person group had a job. I was nominated
                  as the Project Manager. This job involved presenting the project at "Customer Meetings", as well as working with all ten people to have a working product at the end of 10 weeks. We were reasonably successful and you can check it out at <a class="mdl-color-text--primary" href="http://mngr.herokuapp.com/"> MNGR</a>.

                    The goal of DropX is to entice people out of their homes. It does this through allowing people to share their unique experiences outside But for the user to find these events, they must physically leave their home and go hunt for them.  If you are interested in this project, ask me. I have plenty to talk about.

                    This is a rather meta post, but yes this website is a tiny project of mine. I decided to go with a Material Design, solely from my experience of making Android Applications. Over time Google has convinced me Material provides simplicity to good design. <br>
